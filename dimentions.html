    <div class="box">Most Fire & Rescue Services now use their own individual mascots and cartoon characters to teach children about the importance of fire safety. During the late 1990s / early 2000s Welephant was gradually phased out from UK Fire Service merchandising and safety campaigns, but he continued to be used extensively as the Mascot for the National Fire Safety Charity

        Since Welephant the popular BBC (until early 2008), HIT Entertainment and S4C Stop Motion/CGI Character Fireman Sam has been used by the UK Government in various fire safety campaigns aimed at young children.
        
        Other characters such as 'Frances the Firefly', 'Adam Alarm' and others have also been used.
        
        Welephant is currently the Mascot of the Children's Burn Trust.
        
        In the fifth episode of the first series of the TV firefighting drama series London's Burning, Leading Fireman Malcolm Cross wears a Welephant costume for a fire station open day. </div>
